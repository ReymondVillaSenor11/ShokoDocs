## General

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title='System Requirements?'>
    While Shoko itself does not have any minimum requirement and could technically run on just about any hardware setup,
    we do have some general guidelines for optimal performance.

    **Collection Size**

    Shoko works with collections of all sizes, however its important to keep in mind that the larger your collection,
    the more resources Shoko will need to use. Users attempting to run Shoko on devices such as Raspberry Pi's and
    similar
    devices will take significant performance hits and will experience less than optimal performance.

    **Memory (RAM):**

    To ensure smooth operations, it is recommended to allocate at least 1GB of dedicated RAM to the system. Keep in mind
    that during the hashing process, RAM usage can increase significantly. Users with limited memory on their systems
    may experience slowdowns and delays in processes.

    **Hashing Process:**

    Hashing is a resource-intensive operation that involves significant CPU and I/O usage, as the entire file needs to
    be read and processed. If time is not a critical factor and you are willing to trade off processing speed, the
    hashing
    process can be performed on lower-spec systems. However, it's important to be aware that hashing large files on
    lower-spec systems may result in slower performance and longer processing times.
